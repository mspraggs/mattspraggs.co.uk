It's been a while since I last posted here. Sorry. I hope you can forgive me in the fullness of time.

So Thursday the UK decided to leave the EU for some bizarre reason that I still don't fully understand. Many of those who voted to remain feel angry and cheated out of what may have been a more prosperous future than they are now faced with. However, I don't want to rant and rave about how we've made a terrible mistake. I've already done that on Facebook.

Sickeningly, there are already stories and rumours of open racism and/or xenophobia between citizens and EU migrants. As a country we cannot let this happen. This is something we have to fight before it becomes a societal norm.

Here's my simple request, regardless of how you voted: next time you see or hear someone dishing out the racial or xenophobic abuse, tell them to stop. Tell them that this sort of intolerance is not something we in Britain stand for and not something we endorse. Tell their victim that we are a tolerant, patient and welcoming society that doesn't care where they're from.

In the process of dealing with the fallout from the referendum result, let's, as the clich√© suggests, build bridges, not walls.
