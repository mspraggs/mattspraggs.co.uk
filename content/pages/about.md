I'm a physicist turned software engineer currently working as a backend engineer
at [Plum](https://withplum.com), a fintech startup in London.

I received my first degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of
Birmingham. In pursuit of pure science, I then did a PhD in Theoretical Particle
Physics at the University of Southampton. It was during this time I discovered
my passion for software engineering.

After completing my PhD I stayed on at Southampton to develop software for the
[SMARTmove](https://smartmove.soton.ac.uk/) project, an interdisciplinary
project involving electronics, control theory and medicine. I then left academia
to work at [ASV](https://www.asvglobal.com/), an autonomous boat company, where
I mostly worked on control area network (CAN) protocols.

Outside of work I've spun-up a number of personal projects, including:

* [pyQCD](https://github.com/mspraggs/pyqcd) - Python package for Lattice QCD
  simulations;
* [Arduino Robot]({filename}../lego-powerfunctions-arduino-robot.md) -
  creatively-named robotics project involving LEGO, an Arduino and RS232 comms;
* [Loxx]({filename}../lox-cpp-14-virtual-machine-bytecode.md) - my own
  C++14 implementation of the
  [toy language Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
