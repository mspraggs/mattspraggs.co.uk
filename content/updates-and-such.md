I'm acutely aware I haven't written here for... **[looks for last post]** nearly six months. This is mainly due to being busy, which in turn has fostered a "sure, I'll write another blog post, when I have time" sort of mentality. I started thinking this in September and, well, here we are.

To force me to get my act together and start writing here again, I offer you this mediocre excuse for a meaningful blog post. This isn't going to be very long but is going to be a bit more wishy-washy, so if you don't care for that sort of thing, feel free to ignore the rest of this and check back here later.

So anyway, what's kept me so busy for the past few months? Well, finishing my PhD by way of writing my thesis was the main thing. The actual writing part filled up my summer entirely, to the extent that I didn't really do much else. Thankfully this is all now done and I have a nice certificate to show for my hard work:

At the beginning of September I started a job doing software engineering for a [research project](https://smartmove.soton.ac.uk/) in [Electronics and Computer Science](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) at the University of Southampton. This is admittedly a fair step away from a physics PhD, though the latter involved a fair bit of coding, so it's not really a huge leap as far as the day-to-day work is concerned. I've more to say on this, but I'll save it for a separate blog post.

Okay, so I've only got two big things to put in this "list", but they're fairly major. Between fretting over things like my viva and corrections, and easing into a surprisingly different research environment, I haven't managed to formulate anything worth posting here. Now the dust has settled I pledge to post here more frequently and meaningfully.
